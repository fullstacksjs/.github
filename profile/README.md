## About us


**FullstacksJS** is an open-source community focused on knowledge sharing, exploring, and enhancing developer experience. The primary objective of this community is to establish a professional environment for in-depth content in the software development and engineering field.
To learn and strengthen the culture of open-source development and contribution, the projects that are developed in this community are entirely open-source, and members are encouraged to participate.

## Vision

> **WE GROW TOGETHER**

## Motivation

The Internet is full of unfiltered programming content, tutorials, and forums, which provide incomplete, outdated, and sometimes incorrect information to the knowledge seekers in this field. Therefore, we decided to establish a community where experts control and review the contents and activities. This creates a community that values **in-depth** and **correct** content.

## Values

Values form our community and influence its behavior and also have a direct impact on the community's decision-making and content.

* Ethics: Ethics is the most essential value in the community, with the highest priority in decisions. In the community, moral principles are never sacrificed for the sake of other activities.

* Validity: Expert approval is required for every community-produced and published content. If an error is discovered in previously published content, the community must notify the appropriate parties and update the content.
